This project aims to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
the challenge is that

you can only use one global variable per program, also you can only use 
two signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2)

--------------------------------------------HOW TO USE IT---------------------------------------

-1 after cloning the run the make file by typing "make"

-2 then you will have two programs (server and client) run the server first (its ID will be printed)

-3 in another terminal run the client program like this (./cleint ("the-server-id" "any message you want to send")

lastly, you will see that the same message is printed in the first terminal where the server is running
